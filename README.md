# ETWKeylog
Event Tracing For Windows Key Logger

This is a Event Tracing For Windows(ETW) Key Logger POC. The idea is based on the blog post written by [CyberPoint Security Research Team](https://www.cyberpointllc.com/srt/posts/srt-logging-keystrokes-with-event-tracing-for-windows-etw.html).
I decided to assess how easy it would be to duplicate their work so that I could gauge how serious of an issue this kind of keylogger could become.
It bypasses key logger blocking attempts and was tested against Avast's banking mode sandbox.
